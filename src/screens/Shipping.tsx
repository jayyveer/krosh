      <h2>6. Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        All orders require a signature upon delivery unless you have authorized the carrier to leave the package 
        without a signature.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are not available to receive your package, the carrier may leave a delivery attempt notice with 
        instructions on how to retrieve your package or schedule a redelivery.

        If your package appears to be lost or damaged during transit, please contact us at kroshenquiry@gmail.com 
        within 7 days of the estimated delivery date. We will work with the carrier to locate your package or 
        process a replacement or refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend inspecting your package upon delivery and reporting any damage immediately.
